# üçï What‚Äôs That Dish

What‚Äôs That Dish? is a mobile app for identifying and learning about any dish you see ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs in real life, a screenshot from Instagram, or a post on Facebook. Like Google Lens or Yuka, it lets you scan food for quick details, but it goes further by offering multiple ways to identify a dish: take a photo, type a short description, or list the ingredients.

Once a dish is identified, the app shows cultural background, recipes, and even nearby restaurants that serve it, using the Google Maps API. It also connects to trusted data sources like the Canada Nutrient File for accurate nutrition info.

In addition to recognition, users can add their own recipes and get personalized dish recommendations based on their likes and past searches. This combination of AI-powered recognition, community-driven recipes, and tailored suggestions makes food discovery simple, fun, and uniquely personal.
